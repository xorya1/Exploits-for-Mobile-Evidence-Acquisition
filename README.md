# README: Exploits for Mobile Evidence Acquisition

## Overview
This project details various exploits used to gain access and acquire data from Android devices, focusing on resource exhaustion attacks, remote access via Metasploit, and utilizing tools like PhoneSploit Pro. It demonstrates different methods for data acquisition after gaining unauthorized access, which can be critical in a forensics or security testing context.

For more in-depth instructions, including setup, detailed explanations, and additional configurations, please refer to the accompanying **documentation**.

## Exploits Covered
1. **Exploit 1: Resource Exhaustion**
   - Targets an Android device by overloading its resources, aiming to achieve unauthorized root access.
   - Steps include connecting the device to a PC, creating and transferring a resource-exhaustion script, and verifying root privileges.

2. **Exploit 2: Remote Access with Metasploit**
   - Uses the Metasploit framework to establish a remote session on the Android device via a payload.
   - Includes setting up Ngrok for tunneling, generating a payload, and performing various data acquisitions like listing applications, sending SMS, and accessing contacts.

3. **Exploit 3: PhoneSploit Pro & ES File Explorer Vulnerability**
   - Demonstrates how to remotely exploit Android devices using ADB and Metasploit.
   - Includes configuration steps, basic commands for acquisition (e.g., dumping SMS, contacts), and exploiting the ES File Explorer vulnerability (CVE-2019-6447).

## Prerequisites
- **Tools required:** Kali Linux, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Metasploit, Ngrok, and the vulnerable ES File Explorer version 4.1.9.7.4.
- **Android Device:** Version 10+ for testing the exploits.
- **Network:** Ensure the device and attack machine are on the same network.

## Important Notes
- This repository contains proof-of-concept exploits. Usage in a real-world environment should strictly comply with ethical guidelines and legal boundaries.
- The **documentation** file provides additional configuration details and step-by-step procedures for each exploit, which should be referenced for successful implementation.

Enjoy exploring the techniques and learning the process!
